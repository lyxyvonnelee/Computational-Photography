# Computational-Photography
---
I took this course in the junior year of my undergraduate study and it was very interesting! I'll put most of the courseworks here in order to keep a record, but some of them may be missing.

The following is an outline of what I have done in this course.

### What is Computational Photography?
#### from a hardware's perspective
- Camera design that takes computation into account
- More elaborate image manipulation and computation  

#### from a software's perspective
- Definition 1: The use of photographic imagery to create graphics content
- Definition 2: The use of computational techniques to overcome limitations of conventional photography

## Course description
- Computational photography is an emerging field that aims to combine software and hardware with computational image capture, processing and manipulation techniques to overcome the limitations of conventional digital cameras, so that the capabilities of digital photos can be to enhanced or extended. In this course, we will study ways of manipulating and combining photographs and videos to produce new and better pictures, panoramas, 3D models, animations, etc.  

## Course overview
1. Digital image, color space, filtering and Fourier Transform
2. Poisson image editing and interactive photomontage
3. Image colorization and recolorization
4. Image deblurring and non-linear optimization
5. Image completion
6. Texture synthesis and image resizing
7. Interactive image segmentation
8. Feature matching and optical flow
9. Recognising panoramas and multiview panorama stitching
10. Camera model and structure from motion
11. SLAM and AR
12. Single/Multi-view 3D reconstruction
